# Nicolas Rabreau - Scientific and Technical Projects

## About Me
I am a fourth-year engineering student at Phelma (Grenoble INP), specializing in Photonics and Microelectronics with a deep interest in Quantum Physics and its applications in emerging technologies. This repository highlights my work in C++, Python, and Arduino, showcasing my skills in programming and complex technical system management.


## Projects
### 1. IPhy Challenge - Memory of the Future (FeRAM)

Development of a measurement station for FeRAM (Ferroelectric RAM) characterization as part of the IPhy Challenge. This project involved direct manipulation of Arduino ports for data read/write operations and electric parameter measurement.

- Technologies: Arduino, C++, FeRAM
- Key Skills: Embedded systems programming, memory testing, electrical measurement, code optimization
- [Project Link](https://github.com/minfo10/Defis_FeRAM)

### 2. Self-playable Tetris in C++

Creation of a Tetris game in C++ with graphical interface management, saving features, and cross-platform support.

- Technologies: C++, SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
- Key Skills: Object-oriented programming, event handling, cross-platform development
- [Project Link](https://github.com/N1kor4/Tetris)

### 3. TIPE - Dynamic Hydrophobicity Analysis with Arduino and Python

Dynamic hydrophobicity study of different materials conducted for my TIPE (Personal Initiative Project), using a stepper motor controlled by Arduino and image analysis in Python to measure droplet detachment angles.

- Technologies: Arduino, Python, OpenCV, Numpy
