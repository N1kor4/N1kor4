## Projects

### 1. Waveform Plotter

A **Python tool** to read, visualize, and export waveform data from `.txt` or `.csv` files. It supports interactive selection or JSON configuration for batch runs, with flexible plotting, legends, and export options.

* **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Key Skills:** Data visualization, signal processing, automation, workflow optimization
* **Project Link:** [Waveform Plotter](https://gitlab.com/N1kor4/from_waveform_to_python)

### 2. IPhy Challenge – Memory of the Future (FeRAM)

Development of a measurement station for **Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM)** characterization. The project involved direct manipulation of Arduino ports for data read/write operations and electrical parameter measurement.

* **Technologies:** Arduino, C++, FeRAM
* **Key Skills:** Embedded systems programming, memory testing, electrical measurement, code optimization
* **Project Link:** [FeRAM Challenge](https://github.com/minfo10/Defis_FeRAM)

### 4. TIPE – Dynamic Hydrophobicity Analysis with Arduino and Python

Study of dynamic hydrophobicity of various materials using a **stepper motor controlled by Arduino** and **image analysis in Python** to measure droplet detachment angles.

* **Technologies:** Arduino, Python, OpenCV, NumPy
* **Key Skills:** Stepper motor control, image processing, experimental data analysis, fluid dynamics
* **Project Link:** [TIPE Hydrophobicity](https://github.com/N1kor4/TIPE_PC)

If you want, I can also **rewrite the Waveform Plotter section** with a **more GitHub-readme-friendly style**, including interactive examples, folder structure, and a small table of features—so it looks extremely professional and visually appealing.

Do you want me to do that next?
