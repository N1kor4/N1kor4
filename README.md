## Projects

### 1. Eminent Earth – Privacy-Focused Web Portfolio

**Eminent Earth** is a personal web project that showcases my profile and work while emphasizing **privacy and security**. I built it with **Astro**.

* **Technologies:** Astro, Docker, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Key Skills:** Privacy-first web development, containerized deployment, static site generation, modern frontend design
* **Project Link:** [Eminent Earth](https://github.com/N1kor4/eminent-earth)


### 2. Waveform Plotter

A **Python tool** to read, visualize, and export waveform data from `.txt` or `.csv` files. It supports interactive selection or JSON configuration for batch runs, with flexible plotting, legends, and export options. Developed during my internship at EPFL.

* **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Key Skills:** Data visualization, signal processing, automation, workflow optimization
* **Project Link:** [Waveform Plotter](https://github.com/N1kor4/from_waveform_to_python)


### 3. IPhy Challenge – Memory of the Future (FeRAM)

Development of a measurement station for **Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM)** characterization. The project involved direct manipulation of Arduino ports for data read/write operations and electrical parameter measurement. Completed in my 4th year in collaboration with CEA-Leti.

* **Technologies:** Arduino, C++, FeRAM
* **Key Skills:** Embedded systems programming, memory testing, electrical measurement, code optimization
* **Project Link:** [FeRAM Challenge](https://github.com/minfo10/Defis_FeRAM)


### 4. Self-playable Tetris in C++

A **C++ Tetris game** with graphical interface management, saving features, and cross-platform support. (Not fully working)

* **Technologies:** C++, SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
* **Key Skills:** Object-oriented programming, event handling, cross-platform development
* **Project Link:** [Tetris C++](https://github.com/N1kor4/Tetris)


### 5. TIPE – Dynamic Hydrophobicity Analysis with Arduino and Python

Study of dynamic hydrophobicity of various materials using a **stepper motor controlled by Arduino** and **image analysis in Python** to measure droplet detachment angles.

* **Technologies:** Arduino, Python, OpenCV, NumPy
* **Key Skills:** Stepper motor control, image processing, experimental data analysis, fluid dynamics
* **Project Link:** [TIPE Hydrophobicity](https://github.com/N1kor4/TIPE_PC)
